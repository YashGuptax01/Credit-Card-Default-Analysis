# Credit-Card-Default-Analysis
Hardware & Software used

The project was developed using various hardware and software components. The hardware used for this project included a computer system with sufficient computational capabilities to handle the data analysis and modeling tasks.
The software tools and technologies utilized in this project include:

Programming Language:
Python - Python programming language was used as the primary language for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model development. Python provides a wide range of libraries and frameworks for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

Jupyter Notebooks: Jupyter Notebooks were used as an interactive computing environment for developing and executing the project code. Jupyter Notebooks allow for combining code, visualizations, and narrative text, making it easier to document and share the project workflow.

Data Analysis Libraries: The project relied on several Python libraries for data analysis, including:
•	NumPy: NumPy was used for efficient numerical computations and data manipulation.
•	Pandas: Pandas was used for data preprocessing, manipulation, and analysis, including loading the dataset, handling missing values, and performing feature engineering tasks.
•	Matplotlib: Matplotlib was used for creating visualizations, such as line plots, scatter plots, and histograms.
•	Seaborn: Seaborn, a data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, was used for creating more advanced and aesthetically pleasing statistical visualizations.
•	Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn was used for implementing machine learning algorithms, including model training, evaluation, and prediction.

Machine Learning Models: Various machine learning models were employed to predict credit card default. Some of the commonly used models in this project might include:
•	Logistic Regression
•	Decision Trees
•	Random Forests
•	Gradient Boosting Models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
•	Support Vector Machines
•	Neural Networks (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras)

Evaluation Metrics: To assess the performance of the models, standard evaluation metrics were utilized, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).

Version Control: Git and GitHub were used for version control and collaborative development of the project code. The GitHub repository provided a centralized location for storing and sharing the project code, facilitating collaboration and version tracking.

By leveraging these hardware and software components, I was able to perform in-depth data analysis, develop predictive models, and draw meaningful insights from the Credit Card Dataset.
